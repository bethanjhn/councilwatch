Council Algorithm Watch Twitter bot

More and more UK councils are using predictive analytics, algorithms and data analaytics to provide their services. This process has happened seemingly in the dark, and many of these programmes have received bad press for being discriminatory, or violating privacy.

The Council Algorithm Watch Twitter bot aims to raise awareness of this issue, and to expose just how many councils are currently using these softwares will little or no oversight. The project is based on the results of FOI requests sent by the Data Justice Lab.

Using a very simple Python code, the bot tweets from a text document with the name of a new council using this type of technology. You can find the code here. The bot is hosted on Heroku.

In addition, the bot also retweets tweets from a selected list of users. They are people or accounts who demonstrably add to the conversation about the use of algorithms in public life. This was programmed using IFTTT.
